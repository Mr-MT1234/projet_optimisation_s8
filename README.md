# Optimisation of Flight Assignment

The flight assignment problem involves optimizing the allocation of flights to aircrafts to minimize costs. This project explores various optimization techniques to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

# Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-MT1234/projet_optimisation_s8.git
cd projet_optimisation_s8
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

To execute the optimization on an instance of the `Benchmark Tail assignment` dataset:
```
python benchmark.py -d 0.5 -p 10 -hz 7 -i 0
```

# Results

The results of the optimization process, including cost and solution visualizations, will be stored in the `benchmarks/`
